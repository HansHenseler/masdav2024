        "2. **draw_maze function:**\n",
        "   - The maze is drawn row by row. For each row:\n",
        "     - The top of the cells is drawn first with `+---+` for walls or `+   +` for open spaces.\n",
        "     - The cell content is drawn with `|   |` where `|` represents the left or right wall.\n",

        "\n",

        "### Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`create_maze(width, height)`**:\n",
        "   - The `width` and `height` parameters allow you to set the size of the maze grid.\n",
        "   - The maze is initialized based on these dimensions, and the path creation logic remains the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`draw_maze(maze, width, height)`**:\n",
        "   - The function now takes `width` and `height` parameters to handle different maze sizes.\n",
        "   - The drawing logic is adjusted to handle any dimensions provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
        "   - In the example provided, a 10x10 maze is created and drawn.\n",
        "   - You can change the values of `width` and `height` to create and draw a maze of any size.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "Running the example with `width = 10` and `height = 10` will produce a 10x10 maze. You can change these parameters to create a maze of different dimensions, such as 15x15, 5x20, etc."

        "\n",
        "1. **`find_shortest_path(maze, width, height)`**:\n",
        "   - This function uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the entrance (top-left corner) to the exit (bottom-right corner).\n",
        "   - It returns a list of coordinates that form the shortest path.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`draw_maze(maze, width, height, path)`**:\n",
        "   - This function now takes an additional `path` parameter, which contains the coordinates of the shortest path.\n",
        "   - If a cell is part of the shortest path, it replaces the center space of the cell with an asterisk (`*`).\n",
        "   - The maze is drawn with the path highlighted.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
        "   - The example creates a 10x10 maze, finds the shortest path, and then draws the maze with the shortest path indicated by `*`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "When you run this code, the maze will be generated and displayed with the shortest path from the entrance to the exit marked with asterisks."

        "\n",
        "- **Centering the Asterisk**:\n",
        "  - In cells where there is no left wall, the space needed to center the asterisk (`*`) is adjusted by adding an extra space to the left of the asterisk.\n",
        "  - Specifically, `\"  * \"` is used instead of `\" * \"` to ensure the asterisk is centered in the visual representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expected Behavior:\n",
        "When you run this code, the maze will be drawn with the asterisks (`*`) correctly centered in the cells that are part of the shortest path, even when there are no left walls. This ensures that the visual alignment is consistent across the maze."

        "### Explanation of the Refactoring:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`Cell` Class**:\n",
        "   - Represents a single cell in the maze with properties `right` and `bottom` to indicate whether these walls are present.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`Maze` Class**:\n",
        "   - Responsible for creating and storing the entire maze grid.\n",
        "   - Contains methods `create_maze` for generating the maze and `find_shortest_path` for finding the shortest path from the entrance to the exit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`MazeDrawer` Class**:\n",
        "   - Handles the visualization of the maze.\n",
        "   - Draws the maze grid and highlights the shortest path using asterisks (`*`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of This Approach:\n",
        "- **Modularity**: The logic is divided into separate classes, each with a clear responsibility. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "- **Reusability**: The `MazeDrawer` class can be reused with different maze instances.\n",
        "- **Extensibility**: If you want to add more features, such as different types of walls or more complex pathfinding algorithms, you can do so without affecting the other parts of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This refactored version of the maze generation script should be more intuitive to work with and extend."
