        "2. **`groups = one_year.groupby(Grouper(freq='M'))`**:\n",
        "   - Here, the data from 1990 (`one_year`) is grouped by month. The `Grouper(freq='M')` part tells Pandas to create groups based on month-end dates. After this line, `groups` is a GroupBy object where each group represents the data for a single month in the year 1990.\n",

        "3. **`months = concat([DataFrame(x[1].values) for x in groups], axis=1)`**:\n",
        "   - This line is concatenating the values for each month (group) into a new DataFrame called `months`. Specifically:\n",
        "     - `x[1].values` extracts the actual temperature values for each month (group `x`).\n",
        "     - `DataFrame(x[1].values)` converts the values for each month into a separate Pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "     - `[DataFrame(x[1].values) for x in groups]` creates a list of these DataFrames, one for each month.\n",
        "     - `concat(..., axis=1)` concatenates these DataFrames horizontally (along `axis=1`), which means each DataFrame becomes a separate column in the resulting `months` DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`months.columns = range(1,13)`**:\n",
        "   - This line renames the columns of the `months` DataFrame to be the integers from 1 to 12, representing the months of the year. This is done for clarity and to make the plot more interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **`pyplot.matshow(months, interpolation=None, aspect='auto')`**:\n",
        "   - This line creates a matrix plot of the `months` DataFrame using Matplotlib’s `matshow` function.\n",
        "   - `months` is the data to be plotted, where each column is a month and each row is a day within that month.\n",
        "   - `interpolation=None` specifies that no interpolation should be applied to the pixels in the plot. This means that the data is represented as-is, without trying to smooth or blend the values.\n",
        "   - `aspect='auto'` allows the plot to automatically adjust the aspect ratio of the plot based on the dimensions of the data.\n",

Each row of the plot represents a day within a month, and each column represents a month, with the color indicating the temperature on that day. This type of visualization can be very helpful for spotting seasonal or monthly patterns in time series data."
